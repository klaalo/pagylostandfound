# Pagy Lost & Found

This is a demo application for [Spring Boot](https://projects.spring.io/spring-boot/) to track lost items. It enabled me to evaluate few cloud services. The idea arose from a discussion in a
[Facebook group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/235855133202437/permalink/1344056399048966/?comment_id=1344098629044743&comment_tracking=%7B%22tn%22%3A%22R7%22%7D)
(see below: [Pagy](#what-id-pagy)) when Katri Huhta suggested that people at Pagy could maintain a website of misplaced property.

## Live demo

## Relying on cloud services

The application is built to rely cloud services so that it would be easy to maintain and simple to migrate between platforms. Read more about utilised services from [the wiki](//github.com/klaalo/pagylostandfound/wiki/InnovationStory). In short, they are:

* Google Cloud Storage Bucket
* Google Cloud Load Balancer
* Google Maps API
* Facebook Comments
